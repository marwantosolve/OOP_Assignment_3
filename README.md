• This is a clean version of Assignment 3 of the OOP course by Dr. Mohammed El-Ramly at Cairo University as mentioned.
• To run the Games and Integrated app make a cmakefile.txt and run all the .cpp files in the folder.
• The GUI is developed and created with C++ Builder so you better install it to recognize the program or get the required files to run it.
• The AI Player and GUI are only available for the four-in-a-row (connect 4) Game which is done by Marwan Osama.
• For more information check the PDF Report.
• Also check the assignment and sheet pdf files to know more about the assignment and those tasks.
